# Blooming

Inspired by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers [Bloom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bloom/id292792586) app, this is an experimental, basic 3D version using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine.

Using your keyboard arrow keys, you and look left / right and move forwards and back to have a wander about. You ought to notice 3D spatialisation effecsts and panning as you look. The mouse also allows you to look up / down.
