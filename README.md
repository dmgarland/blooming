# Blooming

Inspired by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers [Bloom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bloom/id292792586) app, this is an experimental, basic 3D version using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine.

**[Demo](https://dmgarland.github.io/blooming/)**

## Using

Using your mouse, there are three sounds assigned to each mouse button. Click the screen and a note will play at a random pitch, and then loop. Moving the mouse moves the camera and you should notice 3D panning effects as you look around.
